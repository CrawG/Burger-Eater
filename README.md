# Burger-Eater
Bootcamp Week 13 Homework - Eat-Da-Burger!

## Description
This is a "burger logger" app with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This app follows the MVC design pattern, uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.    
 
        
## Usage

[Deployed Burger-Eater App on Heroku](https://mysterious-ridge-16031.herokuapp.com/)

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users  the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name in the "Eat Da Burger" section, the app will display the burger on the top of the page in the "Burger Eating Contest" section, waiting to be eaten or deleted.

* Each burger in the waiting area has an `Eat Me` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the mid-section of the page called "Burgers You've Eaten."

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether eaten or not.
